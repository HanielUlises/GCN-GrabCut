# Exploration 1. Geometry and Segmentation — Getting a First Feel for GrabCut

## Introduction

There’s something deeply compelling about segmentation algorithms: they take a raw image — just pixels, values, color — and draw meaning out of it. GrabCut is one of those algorithms that feels both practical and elegant. It doesn’t rely on huge amounts of training data, nor does it try to hallucinate patterns. Instead, it builds a graph, models color distributions, and optimizes a clean energy function. 

This first exploration isn’t about real-world complexity. It’s about something simpler, but no less interesting: understanding how **geometry** affects segmentation. The idea is to start from the ground up — clean, synthetic images with clear, well-defined shapes — and ask:  
**How does GrabCut deal with shape? What kinds of forms help it? What kinds confuse it?**

## Why Geometry?

Most segmentation benchmarks focus on real-world images: animals, people, objects, texture. That’s fine, but it skips over something important. The **shape** of an object — whether it’s round, pointy, symmetrical, irregular — plays a big role in how segmentation behaves. And if we want to really understand these tools, we should first look at the most basic forms possible.

So we’ll start there. Circles. Squares. Triangles. Pure geometry. High contrast. No distractions.

The goal isn’t to optimize — it’s to observe. To see where GrabCut is precise, and where it gets fuzzy.

## What We're Doing

The plan is simple:

1. Generate synthetic images with a single black shape on a white background. Shapes: circle, square, triangle.
2. Define a bounding box that tightly encloses the shape.
3. Run GrabCut using the standard graph-based formulation.
4. Observe how well it segments the shape — especially at corners, edges, and curves.

We’re not tuning parameters. We’re not adding noise. We’re just watching how this algorithm behaves in a controlled setting.

This kind of exploration helps build the right mental models: we want to know what kinds of assumptions GrabCut is making, and whether those assumptions play nicely with basic geometry.

## What We Expect to See

There’s a working hypothesis here: **smooth shapes like circles** will likely be segmented cleanly. The energy function that GrabCut minimizes tends to prefer smooth boundaries, and a circle gives it exactly that. On the other hand, **shapes with sharp edges or corners**, like triangles, might present more of a challenge — especially if the boundary regularization "pulls" too hard and rounds off the corners.

If this turns out to be the case, we’ll already have learned something useful: that GrabCut has geometric preferences baked into its formulation. That’s the kind of insight that doesn’t just help you use the tool better — it helps you build better tools down the line.

## Why This Matters

This isn't about proving something deep just yet. It's about developing **intuition**. When we understand how a segmentation model behaves in simple, ideal conditions, we’re better equipped to use it — and critique it — in more complex, noisy, real-world environments.

Good tech isn’t just about accuracy. It’s about **understandability**. And explorations like this — clean, minimal, geometry-driven — are one way to move toward that.

## Next Steps

Once we’ve run this basic experiment and looked at the segmentations, we’ll be ready to go further:

- What happens when we rotate the shape?
- What if we scale it down to just a few pixels?
- How does it handle occlusion?

But that comes later. For now, it’s all about geometry. Clean forms. White backgrounds. Watching an algorithm do what it does — and trying to understand why it succeeds or fails.
