# GCN-GrabCut
Grab cut for image segmentation using graph neural networks 

GCN-GrabCut is a novel interactive image segmentation pipeline that **replaces the manual trimap annotation** in classical GrabCut with an **automatically predicted trimap generated by a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)**.

Instead of requiring the user to draw foreground/background strokes or a bounding box + manual trimap, our model predicts a high-quality trimap directly from a few user clicks or scribbles, which is then refined by the original GrabCut algorithm for final precise segmentation.
